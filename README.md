# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction with Dynamic Pricing
## Machine Learning Project with Weather & Event Integration

### 📋 Project Overview
This project implements an intelligent taxi fare prediction system that uses machine learning  
to predict base fares and applies dynamic pricing based on real-time weather conditions and  
local events. Built specifically for the NYC Taxi Trip Dataset from Kaggle.

### 🎯 Features
- **ML-Powered Predictions**: Uses Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting models
- **Weather-Based Surge Pricing**: Automatically adjusts fares based on weather conditions
- **Event-Based Pricing**: Increases fares during concerts, sports events, and holidays
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Flask web application with intuitive UI
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Instant fare calculation with breakdown
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for integration with other systems
